## Setting up a Simple Home Lab

I have been meaning to set up a home lab to play around in and start doing projects. When I began looking into it, I was under the impression it was so much more involved and would require me to get hardware and all. Fortunately, VM's make it much simpler and less expensive to spin up a small lab to play around in. Technically, I already had a home lab that I played in with the VM's from my bootcamp. 

This new lab is going to consist of two VM's - a vulnerable Windows 10 machine and a Kali machine to attack and monitor with. I will be loading both Splunk and Sysmon on the Windows machine before deploying some malware so I can observe what exactly happens when it is unleashed on the machine.
